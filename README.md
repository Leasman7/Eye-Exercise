# Eye-Exercise
This project styles two eyes on the page with CSS and HTML. With the use of javascript, the eyes follow the movement of the mouse around the screen.

## How to Run:
To run this, simply download the html, css, and javascript files and save them in the same folder. Then all that should be necessary is dragging and dropping onto a browser, and it should run. Any modifications would require a file editor, such as VS Code.

## Roadmap
It would be fun to add a bunch more eyes so that the screen is just full of eyes following the mouse across the screen. I also would like o set it up so that some of the eyes follow the inverse of the mouse so that some eyes move up as others move down. The other thing I would like to do is figure out how get the two eyes to automatically show up side-by-side when viewed on a mobile device, as right now they show up with one above the other on my phone.
